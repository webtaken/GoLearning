# Issue CRUL (Create, Read, Update & Lock) CLI made with Go!  
This is a simple CRUL tool for creating, reading, updating and locking issues using the [github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issues?apiVersion=2022-11-28#about-issues).

## Setup
First you need to [generate a github personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to be able to write to your own issues on your repos.  
After you get the token, create a `.env` file on the root of this project and add the following line.  
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN>
```
do not include "<>" on your token.  

## How to use it?
Use the go command line commands:  
```
$ go build  
or  
$ go run .
```
if you dont give any parameter the tool tells you how to use it:  
```
$ go run .
